To scrape a page like the one you've provided, where JavaScript dynamically modifies form inputs and handles form submission, you typically need to use a combination of Scrapy for basic HTML parsing and Selenium for handling JavaScript interactions. Here's how you can approach creating a Scrapy spider that handles this scenario:

1. **Setup:**
   - Install Scrapy and Selenium along with a WebDriver (like ChromeDriver or GeckoDriver).

2. **Spider Implementation:**
   - Use Scrapy to initiate the request and basic parsing.
   - Use Selenium to interact with the page, execute JavaScript, and handle dynamic form inputs.

Hereâ€™s a basic example using Scrapy and Selenium to scrape the login page you provided:

```python
import scrapy
from scrapy_selenium import SeleniumRequest
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys

class LoginSpider(scrapy.Spider):
    name = 'login_spider'
    start_urls = ['https://your_login_page_url_here']

    def start_requests(self):
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield SeleniumRequest(
                url=url,
                callback=self.parse,
                wait_time=10,  # Adjust as needed based on page load time
                screenshot=True  # Enable if you want to capture screenshots for debugging
            )

    def parse(self, response):
        # Execute JavaScript to set username and authtype
        driver = response.meta['driver']
        companycode = driver.find_element_by_name('companycode')
        companycode.send_keys('your_company_code')
        
        userid = driver.find_element_by_name('userid')
        userid.send_keys('your_userid')
        
        password = driver.find_element_by_name('password')
        password.send_keys('your_password')

        # Extract AuthState dynamically from the page
        auth_state = driver.execute_script(
            "return document.querySelector('input[name=AuthState]').value;")
        
        # Set login_ex and authtype to the values you observed in the HTML
        login_ex = '0'
        authtype = '0'

        # Submit the form using JavaScript
        driver.execute_script("document.f.login_exec.value = '1';")
        driver.execute_script("document.f.login.value = 'Processing..';")
        driver.execute_script("document.f.login.disabled = true;")
        driver.execute_script("document.f.submit();")

        # Handle the response after form submission (assuming redirection or validation)
        # You may need to wait for the next page to load or handle errors accordingly

        # You can capture screenshots or other debug information if needed
        if 'error' in driver.current_url:
            self.logger.error("Login failed!")

        # Optionally, you can yield items or further requests after successful login
        yield {
            'auth_state': auth_state,
            'username': 'your_userid'  # Replace with actual extracted value
            # Add more fields as needed
        }

    def handle_error(self, failure):
        # Handle any errors during the process
        self.logger.error(repr(failure))

    def spider_closed(self, spider):
        # Clean up resources when the spider is closed
        self.driver.quit()
```

### Explanation:

- **`start_requests`:** Initiates the request using Selenium, allowing JavaScript execution.
- **`parse`:** Handles form interaction and submission using Selenium's WebDriver capabilities.
- **JavaScript Execution:** Uses `execute_script` method to interact with and manipulate form elements dynamically as per the JavaScript logic observed in the page source.

### Notes:

- Ensure you have installed the necessary packages (`scrapy`, `scrapy-selenium`, Selenium WebDriver) and configured the WebDriver path properly.
- Adjust the `find_element_by_name` calls and JavaScript snippets (`execute_script`) to match the exact IDs and names of elements in your HTML.
- Handle errors, form validations, and redirects based on the actual behavior of the login process.

This approach allows you to scrape pages where JavaScript dynamically modifies form inputs and handles form submissions, ensuring you capture the correct state of the page during login interactions. Adjust the code according to specific details and responses from the website to ensure successful scraping.
