To properly simulate the login process where the `username` is dynamically calculated using JavaScript, we need to ensure that we accurately replicate the logic from the provided JavaScript code. Based on the script you shared earlier, the `username` is constructed by concatenating the `userid` and `companycode` values together with an "@" symbol.

Here’s how you can adjust the Scrapy spider to handle this dynamic username calculation using Selenium:

1. **Inspect JavaScript Logic:** Review the JavaScript logic carefully to understand how the `username` is constructed. Ensure you capture the `userid` and `companycode` values correctly before concatenating them.

2. **Integrate in Scrapy Spider:** Use Selenium within your Scrapy spider to execute the JavaScript code that calculates the `username`. Extract this value and include it in your form data or yield it as part of your scraping output.

Here’s an updated example based on your provided HTML and JavaScript structure:

```python
import scrapy
from scrapy_selenium import SeleniumRequest
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys

class LoginSpider(scrapy.Spider):
    name = 'login_spider'
    start_urls = ['https://your_login_page_url_here']

    def start_requests(self):
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield SeleniumRequest(
                url=url,
                callback=self.parse,
                wait_time=10,  # Adjust as needed based on page load time
                screenshot=True  # Enable if you want to capture screenshots for debugging
            )

    def parse(self, response):
        # Execute JavaScript to set companycode, userid, and password
        driver = response.meta['driver']
        companycode = driver.find_element_by_name('companycode')
        companycode.send_keys('your_company_code')

        userid = driver.find_element_by_name('userid')
        userid.send_keys('your_userid')

        password = driver.find_element_by_name('password')
        password.send_keys('your_password')

        # Execute JavaScript to calculate username
        username_script = """
            var companycodeValue = document.f.companycode.value.trim();
            var useridValue = document.f.userid.value.trim();
            return useridValue + '@' + companycodeValue;
        """
        username = driver.execute_script(username_script)

        # Extract AuthState dynamically from the page
        auth_state = driver.execute_script(
            "return document.querySelector('input[name=AuthState]').value;")

        # Set login_ex and authtype to the values you observed in the HTML
        login_ex = '0'
        authtype = '0'

        # Submit the form using JavaScript
        driver.execute_script("document.f.login_exec.value = '1';")
        driver.execute_script("document.f.login.value = 'Processing..';")
        driver.execute_script("document.f.login.disabled = true;")
        driver.execute_script("document.f.submit();")

        # Handle the response after form submission (assuming redirection or validation)
        # You may need to wait for the next page to load or handle errors accordingly

        # Optionally, you can yield items or further requests after successful login
        yield {
            'auth_state': auth_state,
            'username': username,
            # Add more fields as needed
        }

    def handle_error(self, failure):
        # Handle any errors during the process
        self.logger.error(repr(failure))

    def spider_closed(self, spider):
        # Clean up resources when the spider is closed
        self.driver.quit()
```

### Explanation:

- **JavaScript Execution (`username_script`):** Defines a JavaScript snippet that retrieves the `companycode` and `userid` values from the form (`document.f.companycode.value` and `document.f.userid.value`), trims any whitespace, and concatenates them with "@" to form the `username`.

- **Handling in `parse` Method:** Executes the `username_script` using `driver.execute_script` to calculate and retrieve the `username` dynamically before submitting the form.

- **Submission and Output:** Submits the form and yields a dictionary with `auth_state` (extracted from the page), `username` (dynamically calculated), and potentially other fields required for further processing or validation after successful login.

Make sure to replace `'your_company_code'`, `'your_userid'`, and `'your_password'` with actual values or variables containing these values dynamically retrieved or set as needed. Adjust the script and handling based on specific JavaScript logic and HTML structure of your target website.
